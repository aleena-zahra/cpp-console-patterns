# Various Patterns in c++ made on the terminal

# Recursive Patterns
These patterns were made with recursive functions, without the help of any loops. These include a chessboard , two different diamond shapes and a windmill looking thing that is satisfying to look at.

# Simple Patterns
I made these for my first programming course while learning basic concepts like new line character '\n' , loops , cout statements and ascii characters. This includes a staircase, infinite happy faces and a very cute house with mountains in the background

# Other Patterns
These include the fibonnaci series, cross pattern, a few random diamond like patterns, and patterns in the recursive patterns directory made with loops instead.
I hope its useful, if not then it is nice to look at.
